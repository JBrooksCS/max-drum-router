# max-drum-router

This patch is an attempt at a new instrument that incorporates two people, (1) keyboardist controlling a synth or VST instrument and (1) drummer, with piezo drum triggers being fed into a drum brain / drum machine. 

  - The key player "assigns" a note to each drum by pressing down on the sustain pedal and then  playing a 4-note chord.  
  - Notes are assigned in the order they are played
  - Notes are "armed" after being pressed on the midi keyboard, and are actually "assigned" to the drums when the sustain pedal is released. This allows the player to arm notes, and then have hands free to tweak knobs while they assign them.
  

More thorough documentation and a video demo coming soon.
